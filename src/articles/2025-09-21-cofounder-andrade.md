We're excited to share that co‑founder José Luis R. Andrade has "locked in" with Deleon, quitting his full time job — an inflection point for our team as we push toward our mission of universal human wellness.

This momentum is made possible in part by the generous support of Boost VC and others. With backing and belief from great partners, we're moving full speed toward bringing daily biochemistry into everyday life.

Deleon is building a palm‑size analyzer that turns a single drop of urine into a clear, daily wellness report. Our approach draws on experience building instruments with NASA for hard‑to‑measure chemistry, applied now to a device designed for reliability and simplicity.
