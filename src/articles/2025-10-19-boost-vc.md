Deleon Technologies today announced a $500,000 investment from San Mateo, CA based Boost VC. The financing strengthens Deleon’s momentum as the company builds a palm‑size device that turns a single drop of urine into clear, daily health insights.


The Deleon platform brings real‑time biochemistry out of the laboratory and into daily workflows. In minutes, the device measures key metabolomic signals and translates them into simple guidance—supporting decisions around training, recovery, nutrition, and early indicators of health risk.


Deleon’s engineering approach draws on experience building advanced instruments with NASA to detect hard‑to‑measure chemistry. The team is applying that rigor to a system designed for reliability, portability, and ease of use in the field.


Funding will be used to accelerate product engineering, expand pilot deployments with partners, and grow the team across hardware, software, and applied science.
