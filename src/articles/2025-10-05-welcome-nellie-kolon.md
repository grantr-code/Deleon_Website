We’re excited to share that as of last week, Nellie Kolon joined Deleon as one of our first team members.

At Deleon, we’re building personal metabolomics technology to make daily insights into wellness accessible and actionable. Nellie will support work across assay development and system validation as we translate a single drop of urine into a clear daily health report.

Thank you to Chad Pozarycki, PhD and José Luis R. Andrade for helping welcome Nellie to the team — more updates soon as we keep building.

If you’re interested in partnering or joining, contact [chad@deleon-omics.com](mailto:chad@deleon-omics.com).
